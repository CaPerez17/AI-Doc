# AI Doctor Assistant

An AI-powered medical assistant that generates diagnostic insights from audio transcriptions or direct text input using OpenAI's Whisper and GPT models.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >=20.0.0
- **Firebase CLI** (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- **OpenAI API Key**

### Commands to Start Locally

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/CaPerez17/AI-Doc.git
cd AI-Doc
npm install

# Configure OpenAI API key
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
cd functions && firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json && cd ..

# Start emulators and frontend
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,storage --project gressusapp &
npm --prefix frontend run dev -- --port 5175
```

**Alternative:** Use the automated setup script:

```bash
chmod +x LOCAL_SETUP.sh
./LOCAL_SETUP.sh
```

Access the application at: http://localhost:5175

## ⚠️ Security & Credentials Management

### Important Files to Keep Secure

The following files contain sensitive information and are automatically excluded from version control:

- `functions/.runtimeconfig.json` - Local Firebase Functions config
- `functions/credentials.json` - Firebase service account credentials
- `functions/*firebase-adminsdk*.json` - Firebase Admin SDK keys
- `*service-account*.json` - Google Cloud service account files

### If You Need Firebase Admin Credentials

For advanced features requiring Firebase Admin SDK:

1. **Generate Service Account Key:**

   ```bash
   # Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   # Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file
   ```

2. **Place Securely:**

   ```bash
   # Save the file as functions/credentials.json (already git-ignored)
   # This file will NOT be committed to version control
   ```

3. **Use in Your Code:**

   ```typescript
   import * as admin from "firebase-admin";
   const serviceAccount = require("./credentials.json");

   admin.initializeApp({
     credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
   });
   ```

### What Happens if Credentials are Missing?

The application will work fine without `credentials.json` for basic functionality:

- ✅ Audio transcription (OpenAI Whisper)
- ✅ Medical data extraction (OpenAI GPT)
- ✅ Diagnosis generation (OpenAI GPT)
- ✅ Firebase Storage uploads
- ❌ Advanced admin operations (if implemented)

## API Configuration

### OpenAI Configuration

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# Generate local runtime config for emulators
cd functions
firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json
cd ..
```

### Google Speech-to-Text (Optional)

If using Google Speech-to-Text instead of OpenAI Whisper:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set google.speech.key="YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY"
```

## Design Decisions

- **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with modern tooling, hot reload, and utility-first styling
- **Firebase Functions**: Serverless backend eliminates infrastructure management, auto-scales, and integrates seamlessly with other Firebase services
- **Secure Configuration**: API keys stored via `functions.config()` and local `.runtimeconfig.json`, never committed to version control
- **Storage Emulator**: Local file uploads during development without cloud storage costs or external dependencies
- **Environment Separation**: Dev/prod isolation through Firebase project configs and local environment files
- **TypeScript Backend**: Type safety for Firebase Functions reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Reusable Middleware Layer**: Centralized middleware for CORS, validation, error handling, and metrics collection, improving code maintainability and consistency across functions
- **Public download URL for audio in prototype** –  
  For rapid demo purposes we upload the audio to Cloud Storage in a _public-read_ "audio-uploads/" folder and pass that download URL to `transcribeAudio`.  
  • Simplifies the flow (no auth, no signed URLs, fewer lines of code).  
  • Keeps onboarding friction low for evaluators.  
  • Only non-sensitive sample audio is used during the demo.

## Developer Guide

### Middleware Architecture

The application implements a reusable middleware layer that provides:

1. **CORS Handling**: Consistent cross-origin resource sharing configuration
2. **Input Validation**: Request payload validation before processing
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error management and response formatting
4. **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring and usage statistics

Example usage in a function:

```typescript
import { withMiddleware } from "./utils/middleware";

export const myFunction = withMiddleware(async (req, res) => {
  // Function logic here
  // Middleware handles CORS, validation, errors, and metrics
});
```

### Metrics and Performance Monitoring

The application includes a comprehensive metrics system that tracks performance, usage, and costs:

#### Features

1. **Performance Metrics**: Function execution time tracking using Prometheus histograms
2. **Token Usage Tracking**: OpenAI API token consumption monitoring per endpoint
3. **Cost Estimation**: Real-time cost calculation based on token usage ($0.002 per 1K tokens)
4. **Firestore Logging**: Persistent storage of all metrics data with timestamps
5. **Automatic Integration**: Seamless integration with existing middleware layer

#### Design Decisions

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Industry-standard metrics format for potential integration with monitoring systems
- **Middleware Pattern**: `withMetrics()` wrapper provides non-intrusive metrics collection
- **Cost Transparency**: Real-time cost tracking helps manage OpenAI API expenses
- **Centralized Logging**: All function invocations logged to Firestore `logs` collection for analysis
- **Error Resilience**: Metrics failures don't affect core function operation

#### Implementation

Functions are wrapped with the metrics middleware:

```typescript
import { withMetrics } from "./utils/metrics";

export const extractMedicalData = withMetrics('extract')(
  withMiddleware(async (req, res) => {
    // Core function logic
    const usage = { tokens: completion.usage?.total_tokens || 0, costUsd: tokensToUsd(tokens) };
    res.locals.usage = usage; // Pass metrics to middleware
  })
);
```

#### Metrics Schema

Each function call generates a log entry in Firestore:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "extract",
  "ms": 1234,
  "tokens": 150,
  "costUsd": 0.0003,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

This enables cost analysis, performance optimization, and usage pattern understanding.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/gressusapp/us-central1/extractMedicalData \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Patient presents with headache and fever for 2 days, nausea occasionally"}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "extracted_info": {
    "symptoms": ["headache", "fever", "nausea"],
    "duration": "2 days",
    "severity": "mild"
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Diagnosis Generation

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/gressusapp/us-central1/generateDiagnosis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"medical_info":{"symptoms":["headache","fever"],"duration":"2 days","severity":"mild"}}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "diagnosis": "Viral infection",
  "differential_diagnosis": ["Common cold", "Flu", "Tension headache"],
  "treatmentPlan": "Rest, hydration, symptom management",
  "recommendations": ["Monitor symptoms", "Seek medical attention if worsening"]
}
```

### 3. Test Audio Transcription

First upload a file via the frontend at http://localhost:5175, then:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/gressusapp/us-central1/transcribeAudio \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"http://localhost:9199/v0/b/gressusapp.appspot.com/o/audio%2Fyour-file.mp3?alt=media&token=TOKEN"}'
```

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm start                    # Setup environment and start all services
npm run serve:local         # Start emulators and frontend simultaneously
npm run setup:env           # Generate .runtimeconfig.json from Firebase config

# Building
npm run build:functions     # Compile TypeScript functions to JavaScript

# Deployment
npm run deploy              # Deploy functions to Firebase production
```

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"

```bash
firebase functions:config:get  # Check current config
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="your-key"
cd functions && firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json
```

### "Functions failed to load"

```bash
cd functions && npm run build  # Rebuild TypeScript
firebase emulators:restart
```

### Port conflicts

```bash
lsof -ti:5001,8080,4000,4400,9199 | xargs kill -9  # Kill Firebase ports
npm run serve:local  # Restart services
```

### "Git push rejected due to secrets"

If you accidentally committed credential files:

```bash
# Add credentials to .gitignore (already included)
git rm --cached functions/credentials.json
git rm --cached functions/*firebase-adminsdk*.json
git commit -m "Remove credential files from version control"
git push origin main
```

## Security Notes

- ✅ API keys stored in Firebase Functions config, not in source code
- ✅ Local configuration files (`.runtimeconfig.json`) are git-ignored
- ✅ Credential files (`credentials.json`, service accounts) are git-ignored
- ✅ Separate development and production environments
- ⚠️ This is a demo application - always consult real medical professionals

## Future Enhancements / Production Considerations

> **Secure audio handling** – In production we would make the bucket private and either  
> • generate short-lived signed URLs (<5 min) **or**  
> • pass internal `gs://` paths and download the file via the Admin SDK inside the Cloud Function.  
> This eliminates public exposure of potentially sensitive medical recordings while preserving the same backend architecture.

## Technical Decision Making & Engineering Perspective

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 1. **Serverless-First Architecture**
**Decision**: Firebase Functions over containerized microservices  
**Rationale**:
